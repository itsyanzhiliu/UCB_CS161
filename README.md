Everything I found interested from [Computer Security](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS161/).

## 1. Security Principle
- Know your threat model
  - **Threat model**: A model of who your attacker is and what resources they have
  - It all comes down to people: The attackers
 
- Consider human factors
- Security is economics
- Detect if you can’t prevent
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege
- Separation of responsibility
- Ensure complete mediation
  - Ensure that every access point is monitored and protected
  - The time of check to time of use (**TOCTTOU**) vulnerability usually arises when enforcing access control policies such as when using a reference monitor.   
- Don’t rely on security through obscurity
- Use fail-safe defaults
  - Construct systems that fail in a safe state, balancing security and usability 
- Design in security from the start
